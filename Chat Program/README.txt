Chat Program - Ben Bement

My implementation utilizes Java code for a chat program by using 2 threads, one to write to the other program and one to read from the other program. It does this by utilizing the main thread to create the second writing thread and taking in an input port number to connect to.

Steps for running my program:
1. Specify the port number to connect to in either one of the programs
2. Enter a port number in the other program
3. Each program should then be connected and messages can be typed on screen and entered to send a chat to the other window
4. This can be done until the program is terminated manually
